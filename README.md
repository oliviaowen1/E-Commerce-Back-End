The video begins by showing how to create the schema from the MySQL shell, this then shows you how to seed the database from the command line. It then goes on to show you how to begin the applications' server.

It then moves on to Insomnia where first it shows the GET routes for all categories, all products, and all tags.

From here you then see GET routes for a single category, a single product, and a single tag.
